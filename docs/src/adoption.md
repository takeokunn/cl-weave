# Adoption Guide

This guide covers the shortest path from an existing Common Lisp test setup to
`cl-weave`.

## Recommended Shape

Keep the integration surface small:

1. Add `cl-weave` to the ASDF dependencies of the system that owns the tests.
2. Import only the symbols you use, usually `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and
   focused helpers such as `it-property`, `it-isolated`, or `with-snapshot-updates`.
3. Keep one non-interactive command for local use and CI.
4. Keep one machine-readable command for automation and AI tooling.
5. Expose both through Nix if the project already uses flakes.

## Minimal ASDF Wiring

Do not migrate a downstream project until `cl-weave` itself passes the ASDF load
gate documented in [runtime-support.md](runtime-support.md). A targeted source
check is not enough evidence for adoption because downstream projects load the
framework through ASDF.

```lisp
(asdf:defsystem #:my-project-tests
  :depends-on (#:cl-weave)
  :components ((:file "tests/package")
               (:file "tests/main")))
```

```lisp
(defpackage #:my-project/tests
  (:use #:cl)
  (:shadowing-import-from #:cl-weave #:describe)
  (:import-from #:cl-weave
                #:expect
                #:it
                #:it-property
                #:it-isolated))
```

## Native Public Surface

`cl-weave` exposes a native suite DSL only. The supported public surface is:

- `describe`
- `it`
- `describe-each`
- `it-each`
- `before-all`
- `before-each`
- `around-each`
- `after-each`
- `after-all`
- `expect`
- `expect-not`
- `run`
- `explain!`
- `results-status`

The assertion surface is intentionally narrow. Use `expect` and `expect-not`
for value assertions, `signals` for expected conditions, and `finishes` for
forms that must complete normally. Domain-specific predicates can be composed
with `expect`'s `:to-satisfy` matcher. Compatibility aliases are deliberately
not retained.

The fixture helpers below remain part of the supported API because they encode
reusable isolation semantics:

- `with-replaced-function`
- `with-restored-binding`
- `with-restored-bindings`
- `with-restored-hash-table`
- `with-cleared-hash-table`

The native property surface consists of:

- `it-property`
- `gen-integer`
- `gen-string`
- `gen-list`
- `gen-map`
- `gen-vector`
- `gen-state-machine`

The state-restoration helpers above stay in scope because they encode generic
test-fixture semantics rather than project logic: temporary function
replacement, dynamic binding restoration, and hash-table snapshot/reset flows.

Native `cl-weave` keeps only the option surface implemented by the current DSL.
Execution-sensitive structure belongs in the suite tree and runner commands
rather than in compatibility-oriented metadata.

The public surface intentionally stops at generic testing semantics.
Project-specific helpers, such as compiler assertions or domain fixtures,
should remain in the downstream project and call `cl-weave` assertions
internally.

## Nix Entry Points

For flakes, expose the same test entrypoint through both local shells and CI.
The repository already demonstrates the pattern:

```sh
nix develop
nix run . -- --help
nix run . -- run cl-weave/tests --reporter json --output cl-weave-results.json
```

If a project already has a flake, mirror those commands for the project's test
system name so `nix develop` and CI execute the same path.

## CI And Agents

Prefer the metadata command in automation instead of scraping README prose or
reporter examples:

```sh
nix run . -- metadata cl-weave/tests --reporter json --output cl-weave-metadata.json
```

Use the machine-readable reporters for CI gates:

```sh
nix run . -- run cl-weave/tests --reporter json --output cl-weave-results.json
nix run . -- watch cl-weave/tests --once --reporter json --output cl-weave-watch-once.json
nix run . -- list cl-weave/tests --reporter json --output cl-weave-plan.json
```
