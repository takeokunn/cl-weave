`make-mock-function` creates an inspectable function object. `mock-function-p`
tests whether a value is a registered cl-weave mock without signalling on
non-functions. `mock-calls` returns a copy
of the recorded argument lists, `mock-results` returns return/throw reports,
and `clear-mock` resets both histories for one mock. `reset-mock` resets
histories and replaces that mock's implementation with
the default no-op function.
`dispose-mock` clears retained history references and unregisters a mock when
it is no longer needed. A disposed mock cannot be inspected or called. Active
spies must be restored with `mock-restore` before they can be disposed; this
also applies to pending frames in nested spy stacks.
`mock-implementation` replaces an existing mock's active implementation.
`mock-return-value` pins a single return value, while `mock-return-values` pin
Common Lisp multiple values.
`clear-all-mocks` resets histories for every registered mock without replacing
their implementations; `reset-all-mocks` applies the reset behavior to every
registered mock. `spy-on` replaces a symbol's function cell with a registered mock
that calls the original function by default. `mock-restore` restores that
function cell when it is still bound to the spy,
reset the spy history, and restore the spy implementation to the original
function. `restore-all-mocks` applies that behavior to every active spy while
leaving regular mocks untouched.
`:to-have-returned-with` accepts Common Lisp multiple values as matcher
operands, for example
`(expect mock :to-have-returned-with :ok 42)`. Nth mock matchers use one-based
indices. Nth returned matchers count only successful returns, while
`mock-results` still keeps thrown result reports.

`with-mocked-functions` temporarily rewrites global function cells. The
original function cells are restored with `unwind-protect`.
