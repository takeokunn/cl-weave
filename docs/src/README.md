# cl-weave

`cl-weave` is a modern Common Lisp testing framework inspired by Vitest and
designed around Lisp's strengths: macros, conditions, dynamic bindings, and
reproducible Nix workflows.

The project is intentionally dependency-free at the core. It should be easy to
run in CI, embed in ASDF projects, and extend from the REPL.

Start with [Installation](installation.md) and [Quick Start](quick-start.md),
then move on to the [DSL Guide](dsl-guide.md) for the full test-writing
surface.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The capability list below is the intended public surface, and it is
validated by the CI entrypoints documented in [Reporters and CI](reporters-and-ci.md)
on Linux and macOS. Pre-1.0 releases may still introduce deliberate breaking
changes; the expectations are documented in [Versioning Policy](versioning-policy.md):

- `describe` / `it` hierarchical test DSL
- `expect` matcher assertions with readable failure reports
- smart S-expression assertions that capture operand values
- `it-each` and `describe-each` compile-time table tests
- canonical hyphenated variants such as `it-only`, `describe-concurrent`,
  `expect-not`, `expect-resolves`, and `expect-assertions`
- `it-property` deterministic property tests with shrinking
- form-level mutation testing with macro-defined operators
- `it-isolated` subprocess tests for FFI and crash boundaries
- `before-all` / `after-all`, `before-each` / `after-each`, and CPS `around-each` dynamic fixtures
- `describe-skip` / `it-skip` skipped suites and cases
- `describe-skip-if` / `it-skip-if` and `run-if` conditional registration
- `describe-only` / `it-only` focused runs
- `describe-todo` / `it-todo` todo suites and cases
- Vitest-style test name filtering for focused local and CI runs
- Vitest-style test discovery list mode for AI agents and CI tooling
- AI-friendly CLI metadata for typed/enumerated options, artifact schemas with field maps, capability matrix, package exports, policy documents, matchers, mutations, and MOP architecture assertions
- source file metadata in structured reporters and test plans
- Vitest-style deterministic sequence ordering for flaky-test reproduction
- Vitest-style `:bail` execution control for fast-fail CI runs
- Vitest-style per-test `:retry` and `:timeout-ms` controls
- Vitest-style `it-concurrent` / `describe-concurrent` parallel execution modes
- Vitest-style `it-fails` expected-failure cases
- FiveAM-style migration guidance for the native suite DSL
- Vitest-style length, instance, inline snapshot, and external snapshot matchers
- CI-friendly thunk runtime and allocation assertions
- SBCL `sb-cover` reset/save integration for CI coverage artifacts
- Vitest-style mock functions with call history assertions
- ASDF system definitions
- ASDF-aware system runner and watch mode
- spec, S-expression, JSON, JSONL, TAP, GitHub Actions, and JUnit XML reporters
- non-zero process exit on failure for CI
- safe dynamic global function mocking with `with-mocked-functions`

## Guide Map

- [DSL Guide](dsl-guide.md) — suites, cases, fixtures, skipping, focus/todo,
  retry/timeout, concurrency, and table tests.
- [Assertions and Matchers](assertions.md) — `expect`, built-in and custom
  matchers, performance, and numeric assertions.
- [Property Testing](property-testing.md) — `it-property` and the built-in
  generator library.
- [Mutation Testing](mutation-testing.md) — mutation operators and CI score
  gates.
- [Mocking](mocking.md) — mock functions, spies, and call-history matchers.
- [Test Execution](test-execution.md) — filtering, sharding, sequencing,
  listing, bail, subprocess isolation, and watch mode.
- [Reporters and CI](reporters-and-ci.md) — reporter formats, coverage, and
  the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- [AI Discovery](ai-discovery.md) — the machine-readable metadata contract
  for agents and generators.

## Nix Workflow

The [flake.nix](https://github.com/takeokunn/cl-weave/blob/main/flake.nix) at
the repository root packages `cl-weave` as a Nix flake:

- `nix develop` — a devShell with SBCL, Perl, and
  [`paredit-cli`](https://github.com/takeokunn/paredit-cli) for structural
  S-expression edits.
- `nix run . -- <command>` — the packaged CLI (`run`, `list`, `watch`,
  `doctor`, `metadata`, `version`, `help`).
- `nix flake check` — every CI entrypoint (test suite, reporters, coverage
  gate, AI metadata, CLI smoke tests, `paredit-lint` structural parse check)
  as reproducible derivations.
- `nix build .#docs` — builds this documentation site with mdBook.
- `nix fmt` — formats `flake.nix` with `nixfmt`.

Running `direnv allow` loads the devShell automatically.

## Support

Use [Support Policy](support-policy.md) for the canonical support
boundaries.

Use [Issue Reporting Guide](issue-reporting.md) for reproducible bugs
and behavior questions.

Use [private GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/takeokunn/cl-weave/security/advisories/new)
for vulnerability reporting. Do not put exploit details in a public issue.
